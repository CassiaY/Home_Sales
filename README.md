## Project Overview  
Used SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data (see questions below). Created temporary views, partitioned the data, cached and uncached a temporary table, and verified that the table was uncached at the end.  
Sample of the data:

## Project Questions:  
1. What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

2. What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

3. What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

4. What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query (using cache, partitioning, and with neither), and round off your answer to two decimal places.  
- with neither, the runtime was `~1.107 secods`:  
![Q4](/readme_imgs/Q4.png)  
- with cacheing, the runtime was `~0.885 secods`:  
![Q4 cached](/readme_imgs/Q4_cached.png)  
- with partitioning using parquet, the runtime was `~1.122 secods`:
